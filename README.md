- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @klyanyi
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a fullstack engineer. I was a front-end developer for 3.5 years (fun times), and am currently embarking a journey in the back-end world.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to ~~stay sane in the midst of the pandemic~~ be to a better tech person. The world is the oyster.
