### 👋 Hi, I'm Kelly.

#### About me
- 🤓 I'm a software developer. I'm a curious person who enjoys a good cup of coffee, with a passion of learning continously. 
- 🌱 I worked as a frontend developer in my previous role. While I loved (and still do!) working with development and design, I'd transitioned to a backend role - curiosity got the better of me 👩‍🎓📚

#### Technical skills

- JS, Angular2, React, HTML/CSS, SCSS
- Perl, PostgreSQL, Node.js
